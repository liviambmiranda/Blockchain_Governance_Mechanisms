**Simulation Analysis of Blockchain Governance Mechanisms for Inter-Organizational Collaboration in Virtual Enterprises and Virtual Breeding Environments

This project refers to an analytical model based on a simulation of firms' participation to evaluate the long-term feasibility of blockchain governance mechanisms.

This repository contains the Python 3 programming language implementation and descriptions. 

- To support operational validity, a parameter variability-sensitivity analysis was performed varying the firms' participation probability (70%, 80%, 90%). Please visit [Validity_Analysis](Validity_Analysis) to check the code.
